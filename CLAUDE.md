### Code Standards
- Use semantic HTML
- Maintain Japanese language consistency in content
- Keep the design simple and clean
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with proper meta tags

### File Structure
```

### When Making Changes
1. **HTML Changes**: 
   - Maintain the existing Japanese language context
   - Keep the simple, clean structure
   - Test that changes work properly in browsers
   - Ensure mobile viewport meta tag remains

2. **Content Updates**:
   - Keep Japanese text natural and appropriate
   - Maintain consistent styling and structure
   - Consider accessibility when adding new elements

3. **New Features**:
   - Keep additions simple and lightweight
   - No external dependencies unless absolutely necessary
   - Maintain the clean, minimal aesthetic

### Testing
- Test HTML validity
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Verify Japanese text displays correctly
- Ensure GitHub Pages deployment works

### Deployment
- Changes to `main` branch automatically deploy to GitHub Pages
- No build process required - static files are served directly
- Check GitHub Pages settings if deployment issues occur
